# Arduino OPTA PLC

This repository was developed to satisfy the requirements of the Mechanical Engineering Senior Design course at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering by Team 519. 
Team 519 was tasked with developing curriculum for the Introduction to Mechatronics course to enable students to learn how to use PLCs. In this repository, there 
are a number of learning tools, including MATLAB simulation tools, instructions on using OpenPLC, wiring diagrams, and lab designs and solutions.

## Background

PLC's were developed to replace physical relays. Previously, rewiring relays was a time consuming process that led to waste as boards would frequently be thrown 
away instead of repurposed. Now, PLCs are used widely in industrial settings as they provide flexibile and robust programming of industrial equipment.

## Install

This project uses OpenPLC and MATLAB

### OpenPLC

See [OpenPLC Download Page](https://autonomylogic.com/download) to download this software.

It is not recommended to use the Arduino PLC IDE as it has demonstrated worse compatability and insufficient error-correcting documentation.
### MATLAB

See [MATLAB Download Page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html) to download MATLAB if you have not already.

#### Packages

You will need to download the [Simulink PLC Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/help//releases/R2021a/plccoder/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav) package to run the MATLAB simulations of Ladder Diagrams.

## Usage

### MATLAB Simulations

The MATLAB simulations are used to provide students an oppurtunity to learn ladder logic without being being concerned about using or damaging hardware. A number of 
objects have been included to make the simulation as straight-forward as possible.

This simulation is meant to be used for Lab 1.

### Open PLC Coding

Examples are provided for Ladder Logic diagrams that can be used as Solutions to Labs 1 and 2.

## Troubleshooting

Error:

```
Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 74

```
Solution:

Press the 'reset' button on the top of the OPTA. You will need to use a pen or something thin to access the button.
