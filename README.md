# Arduino OPTA PLC

This repository was developed to satisfy the requirements of the Mechanical Engineering Senior Design course at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering by Team 519. 
Team 519 was tasked with developing curriculum for the Introduction to Mechatronics course to enable students to learn how to use PLCs. In this repository, there 
are a number of learning tools, including MATLAB simulation tools, instructions on using OpenPLC, wiring diagrams, and lab designs and solutions.

## Background

PLC's were developed to replace physical relays. Previously, rewiring relays was a time consuming process that led to waste as boards would frequently be thrown 
away instead of repurposed. Now, PLCs are used widely in industrial settings as they provide flexibile and robust programming of industrial equipment.

## Install

This project uses OpenPLC and MATLAB

# OpenPLC

See [OpenPLC Download Page](https://autonomylogic.com/download) to download this software.

# MATLAB

See [MATLAB Download Page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html) to download MATLAB if you have not already.

### Packages

You will need to download the [Simulink PLC Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/help//releases/R2021a/plccoder/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav) package to run the MATLAB simulations of Ladder Diagrams.
