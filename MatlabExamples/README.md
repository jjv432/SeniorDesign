## motor_led_main (LAB 1)

This file creates an animation of two buttons controlling a system with two LEDs and a motor. The students should use this script to animate their work for Lab 1. The difference will be that they reference their own .slx file instead of the one that is provided in the src folder now. 

## motor_animation_main

This file is similar to motor_led_main, but instead of one motor and two leds, it just has two motors.
